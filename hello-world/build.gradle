/*
TODO: Define the dependencies for both the compile and test
scopes. We need the following dependencies:
	
log4j v.1.2.17 (for everything)
junit v.4.12   (for testing only)

Also make sure to configure the 'jar' task so that it looks
similar to the one shown in class.

Remember to use the 'java' plugin. You can reference the
Maven Central repository.
